## Design

Color selection is a key component to any design process, Safeguarding the planet Earth requires to show bright beautifull colors. Water, land, Grass these are the main elements in showing colors of our earth. The artwork and color selection thus played a integral part in the design of this project as they were essential in creating a welcoming and appropriate page for the end user and their specific needs

So, keeping in mind the combination of blue and green, theme of the website was set accordingly. I was able to determine an appropriate color scheme that is aesthetically pleasing whilst being both calming and engaging.

## Fonts

As with color, font was a big consideration for ensuring a positive user experience whilst visiting the page.
Two sans-serif fonts were selected for the project, and implemented via Google Fonts using a direct import code within the style.css file.

<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto" rel="nofollow">Roboto</a> was proven to be the best choice for the creation of this project.

Different sizes ranging from 100 till 700 were used.
## Imagery
The image selection became a key influence in the design of the overall project, including naming and branding.
#### Hero section
Image for hero section was selected after careful consideration. It represents the deep colors of Earth fading away that needs to be safeguarded.

#### Video Container
This part was selected to show a video of ocean, to appeal users attention towards the fact that oceans need to be saved to save water, relatively saving Earth.

#### Action Container
Here I used background picture of green earth ball to appeal users attention towards 10 actions that can safeguard Earth.

##### Cards section
Here the image of recycling hand is used to appeal users towards need of using three important R's of safeguarding Earth.

## Features
#### General Features
In order to fulfil the criteria the page consists of various sectioned information each with a variety of links, resources and other elements that contribute to a positive user experience.
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap Framework</a> was used for general styling and designing. 

 ###### Navigation and Hero Section
 I chose to use a bold and welcoming hero section for the start of the page using the Bootstrap Jumbotron.

This gives a clear indication of the content as well as imagery that links to the brand and identity of the organisation.

Within this section I have included two buttons that present easy to navigate options for the user to access the relevant section of the page for their needs.

###### Bootstrap Cards
I utilise the bootstrap cards option to describe three R's (recycle, reuse, reduce) of safeguarding Earth.

##### Footer
For the footer again I implemented a Bootstrap component.

Here I have used the bold contrast of the blue shades to distinguish it apart from the rest of the page allowing it to be easily identifiable across the whole website.

##### Responsive Design
Utilising the Bootstrap Framework allowed for an implementation that is responsive without the need for additional CSS or media queries.

Though it took some experimentation and troubleshooting, I have been able to create a page that is fully responsive to modern standards.
